# Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher

## Task

The letters in the file [ciphertext.txt](./ciphertext.txt) are encrypted with a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.
The encrypted message consists of a single line, ending with a newline.

Decrypt the message!

## How

1. **Write a program that sorts the letters of the encrypted message text by frequency**

   - a. Use your developed frequency analyzer to derive the statistical distribution of the letters.
   - b. Do not use an online tool to solve this challenge!

2. **Use this [tool](https://homepages.thm.de/~arin07/crypto/monoalphabetic_substitution.html)**
   and start substituting according to the [most common letters list](./english_freq.txt).
